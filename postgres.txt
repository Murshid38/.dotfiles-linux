initdb: warning: enabling "trust" authentication for local connections
initdb: hint: You can change this by editing pg_hba.conf or using the option -A, or --auth-local and --auth-host, the next time you run initdb.

sudo -u postgres 

later change password
---------------------
sudo -i -u postgres
psql
\password postgres to change password 

sudo su - postgres
sudo -i -u postgres
what are the differences?

psql - a client to interact with postgresql database server, use it after 'sudo -i -u postgres'

added in postgresql.conf located in /var/lib/pgsql/16/data
listen_addresses = '*'      # or specific VM IP (e.g. '192.168.56.2')

restart
add in pg_hba.conf located in /var/lib/pgsql/16/data
host    all             postgres        192.168.1.0/24          scram-sha-256

why?
# Switch to the 'postgres' user
sudo su - postgres (- is shorthand for --login) -> run 'su - postgres' as super user.
or 
sudo -i -u postgres -> tells sudo to run the command as postgres and give initial login (-i) for that user.


# Initialize the database cluster. The -D flag specifies the data directory.
what is? initdb -D /var/lib/pgsql/14/data

initdb initializes the db structure(necessary directories and files) in that particular directory. like building an empty book library.
default databases created because of the initdb command
template1 - master copy, our dbs will copy from this template
template0 - to fix if template1 gets corrupted
postgres - default database for administration tasks

The /var directory is for files whose content is expected to change continuously during the normal operation of the system. This includes things like system logs (/var/log), mail spools, and most importantly, the data managed by services like databases.

The subdirectory /var/lib is specifically designated for "state information" from applications. Your PostgreSQL database is the persistent state of the postgresql service. Therefore, according to the Linux standard, /var/lib/pgsql is the correct and logical place for it to live.
