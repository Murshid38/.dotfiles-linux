creating a host-only adapter in virtualbox.
-------------------------------------------

VBoxManage hostonlyif create

VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig vboxnet0 --ip 192.168.56.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0

running a vm headless
---------------------
VBoxManage startvm "Your_VM_Name" --type headless
VBoxManage controlvm "Your_VM_Name" poweroff

exploring guest properties
--------------------------
VBoxManage guestproperty get "VM_NAME" "/VirtualBox/GuestInfo/Net/0/V4/IP"
vboxmanage guestproperty enumerate "FreeBSD"

# Access the VM(in VirtuaBox) from host in local network
settings -> Network -> Host-Only Adapter

select vboxnet0
if not found -> (in terminal) VBoxManage hostonlyif create
confirm by -> VBoxManage list hostonlyifs

# Setting ip address range for host-only adapter 
VBoxManage hostonlyif ipconfig vboxnet0 --ip 192.168.56.1 --netmask 255.255.255.0

# Access the VM(in VirtuaBox) from other devices in local network

settings -> Network -> Bridged Adapter
ip addr

# Access the VM(in VirtuaBox) from other devices in outside network

settings -> Network -> NAT Adapter
Advanced -> port forwarding

add a rule
Protocol: TCP
Host Port: 8080 (or any open port)
Guest IP: (Leave blank)
Guest Port: 80 (or the port your server runs on)

can access the server using: http://localhost:8080

Networking Modes
----------------

NAT(default) - VM will act like it's behind a router(virtual box will act like the router), vm will host internet connection to access internet. host can't connect to that VM directly like SSH. if we want to connect we need to setup port forwarding.

bridged - guest VMs and host will be like a in LAN network, so all of them can interact with each other. VMs will get IP addresses in the routers range. easy to ssh into from any device in the same network.

host only - host and guest vm will be like in a private network. but only host can access the internet. (vm can access internet using a second adapter if needed)
