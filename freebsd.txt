freebsd also supports linux applications

Vulkan, directx, OpenGL -> Graphics APIs given by the graphics drivers to talk to the graphics card.

OpenGL - cross platform e.g. blender
Vulkan - cross platform (newer library) e.g. Unreal Engine
DirectX - Windows games

i915 - kernel driver for Intel integrated GPUs
iris or i965 - User space graphics driver for Intel integrated GPUs

above two open sources drivers are provided by Mesa(a driver stack, collection of open source graphic drivers that implements OpenGL,Vulkan...) for linux Intel/AMD GPUs. 

Services
--------
uses BSD style init scripts as init system.(rc scripts and configuration) 

main config file is in /etc/rc.conf to enable which services to start at boot.

enable sshd at boot -> sudo sysrc sshd_enable=YES

sudo service sshd start

check status -> service sshd status

see if it's listening -> sockstat -4 -l | grep ssh
should see something like this -> root     sshd     1234  3  tcp4   *:22 *:*

checking firewall if any
sudo ipfw list     # If using ipfw
sudo pfctl -sr     # If using pf (Packet Filter)
